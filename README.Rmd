# BLscore

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

BLscore provides functions to identify clusters of convergent TCRs 
that are likely to recognize the same peptide. The clustering is based on
pairwise comparisons of all TCRs by aligning their CDR1-3 and calculating 
the alignment scores using BLOSUM62 substitution matrix reflecting evolutionary 
amino acid interchangeability. The three alignment scores (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) 
are logistically transformed into a single score (BL-score, BLOSUM-logistic) 
ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 corresponds to the highest probability of specificity 
match and 0 to the lowest. Because the CDRs differ in their impact on TCR
specificity, they are weighted differently in the logistic function. 
The weights and clustering thresholds were established using available data 
sets of TCRs with known specificity (VDJdb and IEDB).

## Installation

You can install the development version of BLscore from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("obrzts/BLscore_private")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(BLscore)
#head(sample_data_B)
```

```{r}
#clusterize_TCR(sample_data_B, chains="AB", tmp_folder=".", ncores=4)
```
