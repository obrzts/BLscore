# BLscore

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

BLscore provides functions to identify clusters of convergent TCRs 
that are likely to recognize the same epitope. The clustering is based on
pairwise comparisons of all TCRs by aligning their CDR1-3 and calculating 
the alignment scores using BLOSUM62 substitution matrix reflecting evolutionary 
amino acid interchangeability. The three alignment scores (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) 
are logistically transformed into a single score (BL-score, BLOSUM-logistic) 
ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 corresponds to the highest probability of specificity 
match and 0 to the lowest. Because the CDRs differ in their impact on TCR
specificity, they are weighted differently in the logistic function. 
The weights and clustering thresholds were established using available data 
sets of TCRs with known specificity (VDJdb and IEDB).

## Installation

You can install the development version of BLscore from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("obrzts/BLscore")
```

If you experience troubles with R connecting to GitHub, download zipped package from 
the website and run:

``` r
devtools::install_local("BLscore-master.zip")
```

## Usage

BLscore's main function is `clusterize_TCR()` which takes a data.frame with TCR 
sequence data, calculate pairwise BL-scores, uses them to define clusters of
similar TCRs and returns a data.frame with cluster ids.

The input data.frame must contain the following fields:

* junction_beta - amino acid sequence of CDR3 plus the two conserved anchor
residues;
* v_beta, j_beta - V and J gene with or without allele; allele information is 
not used for the score calculation.

If paired chain clustering is desired junction_alpha, v_alpha and j_alpha must 
be provided too.

Here is an example:

```{r}
library(BLscore)
head(example_TCR_df)
```

Note, that the default thresholds for clustering were defined for full junction
sequences. Providing only CDR3 sequence without anchor residues may lead to less
accurate cluster assignment. If you have only CDR3 sequences you can add anchor 
residues with `add_cdr3_anchors()` function:

```{r}
# make example table without anchor residues
df <- example_TCR_df
df$cdr3_beta <- substr(df$junction_beta, 2, nchar(df$junction_beta) - 2)

# generate column with beta chain junction sequence
df <- add_cdr3_anchors(df, chains="B", species="human")
head(df)
```

Then run clustering: 

```{r}
clusters = clusterize_TCR(df, chains="AB", id_col = "id", tmp_folder=".", ncores=4)
head(clusters)
```
