Description: BLscore provides functions to identify clusters of convergent
    TCRs that are likely to recognize the same peptide. The clustering is
    based on pairwise comparisons of all TCRs by aligning their CDR1-3 and
    calculating the alignment scores using BLOSUM62 substitution matrix
    reflecting evolutionary amino acid interchangeability. The three
    alignment scores (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) are logistically transformed
    into a single score (BL-score, BLOSUM-logistic) ranging from 0 to 1,
    where 1 corresponds to the highest probability of specificity match
    and 0 to the lowest. Because the CDRs differ in their impact on TCR
    specificity, they are weighted differently in the logistic function.
    The weights and clustering thresholds were established using available
    data sets of TCRs with known specificity (VDJdb and IEDB).
